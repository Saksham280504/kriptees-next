                      KRISHNA SINGH believes in helping its customers as far as
                      possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy.
                      Under this policy:
                    </p>
                  </dd>
                </div>
                <div className="bg-white px-4 py-5 sm:grid sm:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-4 sm:px-6">
                  <dt className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-500"></dt>
                  <dd className="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-900 sm:col-span-2 sm:mt-0">
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                      <li>
                        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is
                        made immediately after placing the order. However, the
                        cancellation request may not be entertained if the
                        orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants
                        and they have initiated the process of shipping them.

                        KRISHNA SINGH does not accept cancellation requests for
                        perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
                        refund/replacement can be made if the customer
                        establishes that the quality of product delivered is not
                        good.

                      <li>
                        In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please
                        report the same to our Customer Service team. The
                        request will, however, be entertained once the merchant
                        has checked and determined the same at his own end. This
                        should be reported within 7 Days days of receipt of the
                        products.

                        In case you feel that the product received is not as
                        shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must
                        bring it to the notice of our customer service within 7
                        Days days of receiving the product. The Customer Service
                        Team after looking into your complaint will take an
                        appropriate decision.

                        In case of complaints regarding products that come with
                        a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to
                        them.

                        it'll take 6-8 Days days for the refund to be processed
